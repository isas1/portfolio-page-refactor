# My Porfolio Page!

In an attempt to better learn React.js and just understand all things JavaScript at a better level I'm building a new Portfolio site.

## Current Goals

* Single Responsibility - as much as possible I'd like each component, function and const to do one thing.
  * Refactor the NavBar Component
  * Refactor the Unsplashed API
* Consistency with styles
  * Use of in-line component styles throughout
  * If another method has been used, explain why
  
## Tools used

* NPM
* Create-react-app
* React-dom
* Material-UI
* React-typist
* React-iframe
* React-icons - Font Awesome

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
